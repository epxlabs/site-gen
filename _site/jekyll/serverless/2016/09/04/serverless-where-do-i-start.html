<h1 id="serverless---where-do-i-start">Serverless - Where do I start?</h1>

<p>We field many inquiries and the general questioning follows the path:</p>

<p>“Okay, we agree, Serverless is awesome, but a complete rewrite at this time sounds expensive - where should we start?”</p>

<p>For this we recommend developing a infrastructure strategy that couples cost savings with Serverless component implementations overtime.</p>

<p>A general format for this type of engagement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Requirements gathering and Infrastructure cost center anaylsis (we figure out where we can save money off the bat)</li>
  <li>Select the lowest hanging fruit to be converted, cost-effectively, to Serverless systems</li>
  <li>Roll-out cost savings or Serverless enhancements in Agile sprints: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)</a> or following the Kanban method: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban</a></li>
  <li>Accrue cost savings, plan further enhancements, rinse and repeat</li>
</ul>
