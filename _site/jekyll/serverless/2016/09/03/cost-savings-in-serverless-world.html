<p>EPX Labs loves to save money. Saving our clients money is a win-win proposition.</p>

<p>We typically engage clients with a requirements gathering and infrastructure analysis technical spike.</p>

<p>Our analysis provides us with the data to target major cost centers of our clients cloud deployments and produce coherent strategies for rolling out cost saving infrastructure enhancements.</p>

<p>Some of the enhancements and major cost centers we have encountered in the past:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unnecessary database caching</li>
  <li>Over-provisioned cloud components (EC2, RDS, DynamoDB, S3)</li>
  <li>Poor infrastructure design leading to inefficient data transfer operations</li>
  <li>Improper capacity planning</li>
  <li>Missed auto-scaling opportunities</li>
  <li>Lack of applying Serverless design principles (leveraging AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Google Cloud Functions, IBM OpenWhisk, Azure Functions, et. al.)</li>
  <li>Levering the best technologies available which are optimized for speed and cost (reducing legacy overhead and technical debt simultaneously)</li>
  <li>Moving long term storage and backups with disaster recovery to more cost effective solutions</li>
</ul>

<p>Opening up IT budget grants us the ability to focus on enhancing the end-users experience and providing customers with more value.</p>

<p>Typically after our first cost savings iteration smiles turn to improved budgets and plans/wishes turn into projects.</p>

<p>On a recent engagement EPX Labs - through a DevOps, Clojure and Pursuit of Serverless strategy - reduced a clients monthly cloud costs by more than half.</p>

<p>Imagine what you could do if you cloud bill was less than half of your current monthly expenditure (give much deserved raises to your best employees, hire more personnel, enhance your marketing and sales budget, reallocate the savings to your product development, move your product into more verticals, etc.)</p>

<p>Here is a snap of EPX Labs curtailing cloud infrastructure spend by more than half on AWS (amazon web services):</p>

<p>And the same bar chart in linear fashion.</p>

<p>For AWS costs you can refer to AWS pricing: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/">https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/</a></p>

<p>Take special note of the AWS free tier which is heavily exploited when applying serverless design principles (AWS Lambda et al.): <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">https://aws.amazon.com/free/</a></p>
