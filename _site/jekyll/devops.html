      The birth of the cloud brought us many wonderful things and a few less wonderful things. While it is easier than ever to provision large amounts of servers and bring mountains of compute power to bear on a problem, there is a tremendous amount of complexity in even a simple app at any kind of scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think about your computer for a minute. How often do you check for viruses? How often do you run security updates? How often do you make sure that every single app running on your computer or phone is up to date?
    </p>

    <p>
      Unless you are a system administrator or you work in IT, you probably don’t check those things very often. It takes time right?
    </p>

    <p>
      Well here’s the thing, what happens when your web app or mobile app backend API is running on a load balancer, 4 web servers, two database server instances, 2 caching servers, an elastic search cluster of at least a few nodes and so on? 
    </p>

    <p>
      You are talking about keeping at least ten servers up to date with the latest security patches, software updates, automation scripts, and that doesn’t even include deployment infrastructure or scaling needs. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Who is taking care of all those updates and all that complexity? And, if you are fortunate enough to do well and your app goes viral, can it scale up to meet demand? Is what you’re doing now at hundreds or thousands of users going to scale up to thousands or millions of users?
    </p>

    <p>
      Those kinds of problems are what DevOps is about. It’s about taking rock solid system administration principles and practices and then applying cutting edge agile software development principles and practices to automate all the complexity into a manageable system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Look, we understand that your eyes glaze over when you see an architecture diagram to visualize a complex infrastructure system. But, to truly operate at web scale on the cloud, you need to tame the complexity.
    </p>

    <p>
      At EPX Labs, we are experts in leveraging our years of DevOps expertise to turn a tangled mess of cloud servers and compute instances into a manageable system that scales up and down to meet your needs. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We only provide the best infrastructure solutions to our clients and automating the cloud using DevOps is a critical part of turning your infrastructure from a liability and a risk to a valuable asset and a competitive advantage.
    </p>

    <p>
      We know that this stuff is hard. Everybody and their brother is claiming to do DevOps now whether they have experience or not. Yet, many of those projects go south in a hurry because it’s a lot more than running a couple software updates with a cron job.
    </p>

    <p>
      Real World Class Infrastructure requires the right combination of up front design, automation, and scalability from day one if you ever hope to truly leverage the power of the cloud.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our clients use our expertise to get the most out of their investment in the cloud and getting DevOps right is a huge part of the value we can provide your business.
