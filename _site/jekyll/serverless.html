    <p>That is one way to think about serverless technologies like AWS Lambda. It doesn’t mean that servers no longer exist. </p>

    <p>Instead, you no longer think in terms of servers, operating systems, processes, ram, patches, updates, and all those infrastructure headaches of the past. No longer do you need to orchestrate a fleet of servers in perfect unison to achieve scalability on the cloud.</p>

    <p>With the rise of serverless computing, you have the nearly infinite capacity of Amazon Web Services, the same technology that powers worldwide web scale services at Netflix, without with configuration and management overhead of servers.</p>

    <p>One of the most important principles of good infrastructure management is simple beats complex where possible. That is one reason why Clojure is so powerful. It is simple.</p>

    <p>AWS Lambda brings simplicity to your infrastructure.</p>

    <p>In the world of serverless, your code is treated more like a program being run on a giant computer than it is treated like a bunch of computers running your code. What I mean is, you don’t worry about how many EC2 instances are running your code, you don’t worry if those instances have enough memory or compute power, you don’t worry about operating systems, patches, configuration scripts or any of that.</p>

    <p>AWS Lambda acts as a kind of cloud operating system where your code executes when its needed and shuts down. Just like if you ran a program on your laptop. You start the program, it runs, and it closes. </p>

    <p>AWS Lambda does that for you automatically whenever your code needs to run.</p>

    <p>You are only charged when the code runs.</p>

    <p>Because of this radically different model, the cost savings of using AWS lambda is dramatic. Often you can lower cost by 90% over a traditional AWS EC2 backed system. </p>

    <p>Much of the cost savings comes from being able to “turn the server off” automatically on AWS Lambda without any extra effort. With enough automation, companies have achieved similar results on Amazon EC2, but there is one big problem with the traditional autoscaling automation approach...</p>

    <p>It is too complicated.</p>

    <p>And because it’s complicated, almost nobody using the cloud is able to scale up and down based on current demand.</p>

    <p>Instead, many companies will over-provision their servers by two or four times what they need because “servers are cheap” and “people are expensive”. To some extent, this is true. </p>

    <p>It’s also wasteful. </p>

    <p>We believe World Class Infrastructure is efficient and in our experience, AWS Lambda is the most efficient infrastructure service we’ve seen on the cloud.</p>

    <p>Our clients are already migrating parts of their systems to a serverless approach and the results are stunning. The infrastructure costs drop dramatically, as much as 90%! Even better than that, the complexity of running their infrastructure vanishes.</p>

    <p>Every client we’ve done pilot projects with is looking at more ways to move services over to AWS Lambda. It’s that compelling.</p>

    <p>At EPX Labs, we are on the cutting edge of serverless technology and are working to make our clients successful on AWS Lambda.  </p>
