# site-generator

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Run Locally


bin/set_env.sh [STAGE] (Either dev, staging, or production)


`lein ring server-headless`

The site can be reached in your browser at http://localhost:3000/

## Notes on Enlive

Snippets are the parts of your page. Snippets can contain other snippets.

For a static website templates define each page. They contain snippets. A template itself is basically a snippet that serializes its output. So it will return a `seq` of strings.

In larger applications templates need not define a full page and can be a part of a page.

Both snippets and templates require an HTML file on the classpath that they can operate on.

Selectors are like CSS selectors and allow you to specify the part of the HTML that you want to transform. Transformations are the functions to transform the HTML selected by the selectors.


A selector is a vector of predicates. For a logical AND within a selector put the predicates to be AND'ed into a subvector. 

So [:p (attr? :lang)] is going to match any elements with a lang attribute inside a :p element. On the other hand, [[:p (attr? :lang)]] is going to match any p with a lang attribute.

On the other hand sets are a logical OR. So [#{:div.class1 :div.class2}] match every div which has either class1 or class2. This can alternatively be written as [[:div #{:.class1 .class2}]]. Indeed you can have nested "ors" and "ands" which means nested sets and vectors.

## Deployment

Deployment is very simple. We use the `bin/deploy.sh` script:

```
bin/deploy.sh {STAGE}
```

e.g. `bin/deploy.sh staging`

where STAGE is one of production or staging.

`staging` deploys to `staging.epxlabs.com`
`production` deploys to `www.epxlabs.com`

What happens when we run `bin/deploy.sh`?

1. Verify the stage is one of `staging` or `production`
2. Switch the correct stage config to `src/site_generator/active_config.clj`
3. Build the site and export to `resources/exported_site` with `lein export-site`
4. Upload the exported site and related assets to the corresponding website S3 bucket

What happens when we run `lein export-site`?

1. Leiningen runs `lein run -m site-generator.core/export`
2. `export` hydrates templates and exports the site and bundled assets to `resources/exported_site`

Super manual deploy (not recommended):

1. In emacs, navigate to `src/site-generator/core.clj`
2. Use `C-c M-j` to boot a repl
3. Use `C-c M-n` to switch to the namespace of the core file
4. Use `C-c C-k` to compile
5. Run the `(export)` in your repl
6. In your terminal, run `./deploy.sh {STAGE}` (note this will basically repeat the above 5 steps)

This will deploy to staging.epxlabs.com
