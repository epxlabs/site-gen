<p>EPX Labs is a full-service, end-to-end IT Managed Services Partner (MSP).
Our laboratory was founded based on the principle of challenging each and every
costly IT assumption of the past. We believe in implementing Faster, Simpler,
Cheaper, and Reliable IT solutions.</p>

<p>EPX Labs achieves success through:</p>

<h2>Technology Agnosticism</h2>

<p>We choose the best tools to solve each of your specific problems. This
often means Clojure.</p>

<h2>Cost-Consciousness</h2>

<p>We build strong, long-term client-partnerships focused on delivering savings and recurring value.</p>

<h2>Embracing DevOps (APIOps, NoOps, etc.) as a Philosophy</h2>

<p>We make the customer’s experience more enjoyable and your product development life-cycle better, faster, and stronger.</p>

<h2>Utilizing Serverless Micro/Nano-Service Architectures Everywhere</h2>

<p>We architect IT systems which require less hands-on management thanks to automation and ris distribution. Our designs, by default, enable antifragility, high-availability, and scalability.</p>

<h2>Passion</h2>

<p>We’re passionate about what we do -- from clean commit histories to elegant abstraction through thoughtful analysis. You found us because you are passionate about what you do, as well. Together, we will build great tools.</p>
