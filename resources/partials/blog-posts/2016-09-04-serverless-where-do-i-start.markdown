# Serverless - Where do I start?

We field many inquiries and the general questioning follows the path:

"Okay, we agree, Serverless is awesome, but a complete rewrite at this time sounds expensive - where should we start?"

For this we recommend developing an infrastructure strategy that couples cost savings with Serverless component implementations overtime.

A general format for this type of engagement:

 - Requirements gathering and Infrastructure cost center analysis (we figure out where we can save money off the bat)
 - Select the lowest hanging fruit to be converted, cost-effectively, to Serverless systems
 - Roll-out cost savings or Serverless enhancements in [Agile sprints:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) or following the [Kanban method:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban)
 - Accrue cost savings, plan further enhancements, rinse and repeat
