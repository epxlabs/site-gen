# AWS SAM - Serverless Application Model
##### By EPX Labs

Well, this changes things.

Amazon Web Services somewhat darkly [announced a new line of Serverless tooling on Nov 18, 2016.](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/11/introducing-the-aws-serverless-application-model/)

Documentation for "Serverless SAM" can be [found here.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/deploying-lambda-apps.html)

The github repo under the awslabs organization can be [found here.](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model)

What does this mean for adopting Serverless in the cloud?

It's likely a safe bet to start using the new model and tools if you and your organization heavily leverage the AWS cloud. When AWS stakes a claim they follow through and we will likely see great progress and promise over the coming months.

Some questions and comments:

- How advanced will the CLI operations become? Will the Serverless Framework keep pushing forward with inter-cloud and layer on top of the new SAM specification?

- Will AWS foster and promote community contributions to the development of the SAM (Serverless Application Model) and accompanying serverless architecture tools?
