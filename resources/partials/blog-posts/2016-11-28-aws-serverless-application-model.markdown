# AWS SAM - Serverless Application Model
##### By EPX Labs

Well, this changes things.

Amazon Web Services somewhat darkly [announced a new line of Serverless tooling on Nov 18, 2016.](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/11/introducing-the-aws-serverless-application-model/)

Documentation for "Serverless SAM" can be [found here.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/deploying-lambda-apps.html)

What does this mean for adopting Serverless in the cloud?

It's likely a safe bet to start using the new model and tools if you and your organization heavily leverage the AWS cloud. When AWS stakes a claim they follow through and we will likely see great progress and promise over the coming months.

Some questions and comments:

- The Serverless Framework (albeit important and boasts an awesome community) might not be the end-all be-all for AWS Serverless Architectures. The "inter-cloud" narrative around the Serverless Framework might start becoming the more convincing business use-case argument as that feature rolls out to GA.

- Will AWS foster and promote community contributions to the development of the SAM (Serverless Application Model)?

- JSON --> YAML? How are your yaml chops as of late?

- Will Serverless.com slow down active development of AWS features + functionality and leverage AWS SAM moving forward? Will this expose dev cycles and effort around building out inter-cloud capabilites?
