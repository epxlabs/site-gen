    <p>The cloud is great. Amazon freed us from the tyranny of over investing in hardware with minimal long-term ROI and expensive service contracts. We all owe Jeff Bezos a beer and by now as an industry we’ve bought him billions of beers.

    <p>But the cloud has a secret. Once you start building on the cloud you learn a painful lesson. Even the simplest cloud based app requires loads of configuration, management, and maintenance to keep alive.

    <p>And the tools suck.

    <p>Sure, maybe if you got a tiny little app you can run on Heroku for a while, but at some point you need the true power of Amazon’s infrastructure at your command and for that you need DevOps on your side.

    <p>Look, we get it. We understand how this goes. You start on a project and it seems like a tiny little line of business app and before you know it you have three web servers, a caching layer, load balancing, database servers, search servers, and all of this needs to be ready in both staging and production environments like yesterday.

    <p>The cloud was supposed to solve problems, not create them!

    <p>Alas, problems is exactly what we have and it’s not just in how many servers you manage in the cloud, it’s configuring each server to be fast, patched, and secure. Even just staying on top of regular updates across a fleet of servers can be a pain, but once you start having to manage SDK’s, libraries, and a myriad of new threats being announced every day, DevOps is no longer a nice to have.

    <p>DevOps is as critical today as the Database Administrator was for the last few decades. It’s not optional anymore.
