      Clojure is the ideal high-performance, functional programming language to solve technology pains. Paired with a Serverless Microservice Architecture, Clojure and ClojureScript eliminate reliability and scalability issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      This language allows developers to: be more concise; trivially generate universal abstractions; compose functions repeatedly; reuse code and; realize write-once, run-forever investment. Clojure was built from the ground up with concurrency in mind and thus offers major performance gains. It also has seamless interoperability with the expansive Java ecosystem. ClojureScript has the same advantages implementing JavaScript via the Google Closure Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clojure’s macros, transducers, components, concurrency, and composability allow EPX Labs to easily condense thousands of lines of Object Oriented code. The language’s intuitive syntax is based on a core set of primitives and thus allows developers of all skill levels to make meaningful contributions from day one.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe Clojure is an ideal technology choice to add to any company’s set of tools. Antifragility, code reusability, production reliability, and time-to-project-completion are all hallmarks of a well-groomed, collaborative development team with Clojure in their arsenal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At EPX Labs, we are all in on Clojure as the best language to solve our clients current problems as well as an ever growing list of problems even more companies are running into, such as microservices at scale, single app instance performance, big data, serverless computing, data visualization, and more things we haven’t even seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clojure gives our clients a solid foundation to build on as well as significant cost benefits for the lifetime of any software project.
