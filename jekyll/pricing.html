<h2>EPX Labs Pricing</h2>

<h4>Fixed-Bid Projects</h4>

<p>EPX Labs offers SOW-based fixed-bid projects if the following loose requirements are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Business Analysis and Requirements Gathering session is conducted to limit scope (depending on project size).</li>
  <li>A “Technical Spike” Sprint/Discovery Sprint is conducted (this allows our engineers to quickly unlock the unknown unknowns).</li>
  <li>Break Fix/Bug Fix and QA/UAT occurs T&M for a set period of time after Production delivery.</li>
  <li>A T&M Application Support contract and hours bucket is provided for work falling outside the scope of work of the current SOW/Fix-Bid Project.</li>
  <li>If scope increases, the budget project increases by a commisurate amount detailed in a Change Request.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fixed-bid projects are typically discounted based on the volume and scope of work.</p>

<h4>QRF Team</h4>

<p>EPX Labs offers a quick response team to handle emergencies, application development, DevOps support, and security breaches.</p>

<p>A Deposit Fee is held in perpetuity to be drawn against until the Fee reaches $0.00 at which point the Deposit Fee trust account must be refilled. </p>

<p>In the event of an emergency, we guarantee our team of engineers will be actively working to remediate and post mortem the issues within 15 minutes or less than 3 minutes with our enhanced monitoring packages installed.</p>
