<h2>EPX Labs Pricing</h2>

<h4>Fixed-Bid Projects</h4>

<p>EPX Labs offers SOW-based fixed-bid projects if the following loose requirements are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Business Analysis and Requirements Gathering session is conducted to limit scope (depending on project size).</li>
  <li>A “Technical Spike” Sprint/Discovery Sprint is conducted (this allows our engineers to quickly unlock the unknown unknowns).</li>
  <li>Break Fix/Bug Fix and QA/UAT occurs T&M for a set period of time after Production delivery.</li>
  <li>A T&M Application Support contract and hours bucket is provided for work falling outside the scope of work of the current SOW/Fix-Bid Project.</li>
  <li>If scope increases, the budget project increases by a commisurate amount detailed in a Change Request.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fixed-bid projects are typically discounted based on the volume and scope of work.</p>
